Online streaming feature selection techniques for classification learning tasks in open dynamic environments have been widely applied in recent years.
However, the hierarchical structural relationships in the label space of the data are ignored by traditional online streaming feature selection methods, which focus on flat data sets. 
To tackle this problem, an online streaming feature selection algorithm for multigranularity hierarchical classification is proposed. 
Specifically, the algorithm firstly divides the hierarchical structure of classes into multigranularity, 
then defines the adaptive neighborhood rough set model for hierarchically structured data, 
and finally designs two feature evaluation strategies of significance analysis and redundancy analysis to construct the online streaming feature selection framework. 
Experiments on six hierarchical datasets show that the presented algorithm is superior to the other five state-of-the-art online streaming feature selection algorithms.
